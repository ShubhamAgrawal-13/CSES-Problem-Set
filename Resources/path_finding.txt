So when to use DFS over A*, when to use Dijkstra over A* to find the shortest paths ?
We can summarise this as below-

1) One source and One Destination-
→ Use A* Search Algorithm (For Unweighted as well as Weighted Graphs)

2) One Source, All Destination –
→ Use BFS (For Unweighted Graphs)
→ Use Dijkstra (For Weighted Graphs without negative weights)
→ Use Bellman Ford (For Weighted Graphs with negative weights)

3) Between every pair of nodes-
→ Floyd-Warshall
→ Johnson’s Algorithm
